              Input word you would like to remember. Check the checkbox if you want word pronuanciation and definitions generated for you, or write your own notes(you could do both).
              Notes will be generated according to picture. Recommendation would be that you always generate words so you receive the broader explanation of the word and it pronuanciation and edit/combine it with your own words.
              <b>Note that the words where generate is not checked would not be  if they are spelled wrong.</b>
